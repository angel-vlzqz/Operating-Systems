My name is angel velazquez and I am a junior in comp sci big data. I have 2
internships in the power industry but I plan on obtaining a tech internship
this summer. In my free time, I like to work out, read, spend quality time 
with my girlfriend, and I recently found a hobby of learning about vim and
neovim configs and setups.
