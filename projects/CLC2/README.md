To compile the two programs, run this command into your terminal:
```
g++ -o semaphore semaphore.cpp && g++ -o monitor monitor.cpp
```
This command will compile both Cpp files seperately into different programs.
To run the compiled programs, run `./monitor` or `./semaphore` into your
terminal.

For now, ignore the warnings that the compiler throws at you, the program 
should still run fine.
