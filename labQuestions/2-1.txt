Describe the sequence of actions immediately after the OS creates a process
at the explicit request of another process.

This process is known as process spawning. The OS creates a new process
control block (PCB) for the new process and allocates a unique process
identifier (PID) to the new process. The OS also allocates space for the 
process's code, data, and stack. This initializes all of the process's data
structures, including the PCB. The OS then sets the appropriate linkages to 
include the new process in the appropriate queues.
