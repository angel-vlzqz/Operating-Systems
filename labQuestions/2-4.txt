How can the activities of various threads be managed so they do not interfere
with each other of corrupt data structures?

Activities of various threads can by managed using synchronization. 
Synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads 
to shared resources. It is used to prevent thread interference and memory 
consistency errors. It is also used to control access to shared 
resources. When a thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, 
all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for the same object block 
(suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.
