Which type of registers are used by system programs to minimize main memory references?
How is register use optimized?

Registers located on the processor are used to minimize main memory references.
Because of its location being directly on the processor, read and write times are minimized
substantially as opposed to fetching the data from the main memory RAM and/or ROM.
Register use is optimized through algorithms that eliminate the need for 
register-to-register moves. Additionally, minimizing array access can be utilized through
creating variables to reduce cache memory.
