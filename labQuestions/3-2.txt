Explain how a monitor supports synchronization.

Monitors provide a mechanism for threads to temporarily give up exclusive 
access in order to wait for some condition to be met. This is done by calling 
the wait() method of the monitor. The thread gives up the monitor and goes to 
sleep. Later, when the condition has been met, another thread can wake up the 
sleeping thread by calling the notify() or notifyAll() method of the monitor. 
The sleeping thread then wakes up and reacquires the monitor. A monitor 
consists of a mutex and a condition variable. The mutex is used to ensure
mutual exclusion. The condition variable is used to wait for a condition to
be met.
