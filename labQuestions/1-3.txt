Describe how a process, executing an application, is divided into 
threads that can run concurrently.

A process may be divided into multiple threads that can run concurrently.
On a single core cpu, only one thread can run at a time. The operating system
will switch between threads to give the illusion of concurrency. 
On a multi-core cpu, multiple threads can run at the same time with one 
process running per core at any given instant.
