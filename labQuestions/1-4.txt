Explain the mechanism that allows programs to address memory from a 
logical point of view, without regard to the amount of main memory 
physically available.

Without regard to the amount of main memory physically available, this may
be done by using virtual memory. The program is given a large, contiguous 
address space, and the operating system maps the program's address 
space onto the physical memory of the computer. The program is not aware 
of the mapping, and it does not need to be aware of the amount of 
physical memory available. The operating system can also map the 
program's address space onto disk storage, so that the program can use 
more memory than is physically available.
