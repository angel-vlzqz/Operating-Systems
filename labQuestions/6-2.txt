Describe two different types of redundant array of independent disks (RAID)
configurations, stating when one is more likely to use one over the other.

RAID 0: Striping
- Data is split into blocks and each block is written to a separate disk drive.
- No redundancy.
- High performance.
- Used when performance is more important than data protection.

RAID 1: Mirroring
- Data is written to two or more disks.
- Redundancy.
- High data protection.
- Used when data protection is more important than performance.
