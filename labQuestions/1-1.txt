When a new block of data is read into the cache, 
what determines which cache location the block will 
occupy and how is this determination made?

when a new block of data is read into the cache, the mapping
function determines the cache location in which the new block
of data is stored. The mapping function also determines whether 
the data is stored into temporal or spatial locality.
