How is data exchange between the client and the underlying resource meditated
in an operating system? Explain.

Data exchange between the client and the underlying resource is mediated by the
operating system through the use of system calls. System calls are used to
request services from the operating system. The operating system then performs
the requested service and returns the result to the client. This allows the
client to interact with the underlying resource without having to know the
details of how the resource is managed by the operating system.
