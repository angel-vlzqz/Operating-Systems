How do priority levels in UNIX aid the scheduling mechanism?

Priority levels in UNIX aid the scheduling mechanism by 
allowing the system to assign a priority level to each process.
The priority level is used to determine the order in which
processes are scheduled to run. The higher the priority level,
the sooner the process will be scheduled to run.
