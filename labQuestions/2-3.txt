Describe which two fundamental forms of concurrent activity do most operating
systems contain?

The two fundamental forms of concurrent activity that most operating systems
contain are processes and threads. A process is a program in execution. A
thread is a sequence of execution within a process. A process can have multiple
threads. A thread is a lightweight process that can be scheduled for execution.
A process is an execution environment that has its own address space, global
variables, program code, and data.
