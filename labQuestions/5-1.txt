How does a scheduler estimate the processing times for each process, and how
is starvation of longer processes handled?

A scheduler estimates the processing times for each process by using the
information it has about the process. This information includes the priority of
the process, the amount of time the process has been running, and the amount of
time the process has been waiting. The scheduler uses this information to
determine how long the process is likely to take to complete, and then schedules
the process accordingly. Starvation of longer processes is handled by using
priority levels. The scheduler assigns a priority level to each process, and
then schedules the processes based on their priority levels. This ensures that
longer processes are not starved, as they will be given a higher priority and
scheduled accordingly.
