How are fine descriptors and symbol tables used to refer to tiles?

Fine descriptors are used to refer to tiles in the tile cache. The fine 
descriptor is a unique identifier for a tile. It is composed of the tile's 
level, row, and column. The fine descriptor is used to refer to a tile in 
the tile cache. Additionally, the symbol table is used to refer to tiles in 
the tile cache. The symbol table is a data structure that maps fine 
descriptors to tile data. It is also used to look up the tile data associated 
with a given fine descriptor.
