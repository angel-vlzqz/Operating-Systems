describe three common methods for file allocation.

One method is contiguous allocation, where each file occupies a set of 
contiguous blocks on the disk. Another method is linked allocation, where each 
file is a linked list of blocks. A third method is indexed allocation, where 
each file has an index block that contains pointers to the blocks of the file.
